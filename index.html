        This specification defines an API that allows web applications to
        configure the behaviour of app launches with respect to already open app
        instances. This API aims to cater to the needs of single instance web
        apps e.g. music players.

        In order to implement this API, the user agent MUST support

        A music player app wants to direct app shortcut launches to an existing
        window without interrupting music playback. This music app would add a
        [=manifest/launch_handler=] entry to the [[[appmanifest]]], as shown:

          {{LaunchParams}} are passed to the document via a {{LaunchQueue}}

          firing and page scripts attaching the event listener. In contrast the
          {{LaunchQueue}} buffers all enqueued {{LaunchParams}} until a
          {{LaunchConsumer}} has been set.
