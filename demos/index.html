    <h1>Service Worker Launch Demo</h1>
    <p>This is a demo site for the Service Worker "launch" event polyfill.</p>
    <p>Because "launch" is not implemented in the browser, you need to use the
       <a href="simulatenavigate.html">Navigation Simulator</a>. Think of that
       as a test UI for generating incoming navigations into your website.</p>
    <p>This page acts as the "main page" of the site; it uses the "launch" event
       to steal any navigations to the "/compose" URL.</p>
    <p>Note: The demo is unable to focus an existing tab or open a new one (due
       to user gesture restriction). Look for error messages in the console to
       imagine what is "supposed" to happen (or patch Chromium with this <a
          href="https://crrev.com/c/678697">hack to remove the gesture
       check</a>).</p>
