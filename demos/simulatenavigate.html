        The [=manifest/client_mode=] parameter set to
        [=client mode/focus-existing=] causes app launches to bring
        existing app instances (if any) into focus without navigating them away
        from their current document.
      </p>
      <p>
        A {{LaunchParams}} will be enqueued on the {{Window/launchQueue}} where
        the music player can read the {{LaunchParams/targetURL}} in its
        {{LaunchConsumer}} and handle it in script e.g.:
      </p>
      <pre class="example javascript" title="page.js">
        window.launchQueue.addConsumer((launchParams) => {
          const url = launchParams.targetURL;
          // If the URL is to one of the app sections, updates the app view to
          // that section without interrupting currently playing music.
          if (maybeFocusAppSection(url)) {
            return;
          }
          // Could not handle the launch in-place, just navigate the page
          // (interrupts any playing music).
          location.href = url;
        });
      </pre>
      <p>
        A user, already using the music player app to listen to music,
        activating the "Library" app shortcut will trigger an app launch to
        /library which gets routed to the existing app instance, enqueued in the
        page's {{Window/launchQueue}} which, through the assigned
        {{LaunchConsumer}}, brings the library section of the music player into
        focus without affecting the current music playback.

        <p>
          The <dfn data-dfn-for="manifest">`client_mode`</dfn> member of the
          [=manifest/launch_handler=] is a [=string=] or list of [=strings=]
          that specify one or more [=client mode targets=]. A [=client mode target=]
          declares a particular client selection and navigation behaviour to use
          for web apps launches.
        </p>
        <p>
          User agents MAY support only a subset of the [=client mode targets=]
          depending on the constraints of the platform (e.g. mobile devices may
          not support multiple app instances simultaneously).
        </p>
        <p>
          <p>
            The <dfn>client mode targets</dfn> are as follows:
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt>
              <dfn data-dfn-for="client mode">auto</dfn>
            </dt>
            <dd>
              The user agent's default launch routing behaviour is used.
              <p class="note">
                The user agent is expected to decide what works best for the
                platform. e.g., on mobile devices that only support single app
                instances the user agent may use `navigate-existing`,
                while on desktop devices that support multiple windows the user
                agent may use `navigate-new` to avoid data loss.
              </p>
            </dd>
            <dt>
              <dfn data-dfn-for="client mode">navigate-new</dfn>
            </dt>
            <dd>
              A new web app client is created to load the launch's target URL.
            </dd>
            <dt>
              <dfn data-dfn-for="client mode">navigate-existing</dfn>
            </dt>
            <dd>
              If an existing web app client is open it is brought to focus and
              navigated to the launch's target URL. If there are no existing web
              app clients the [=client mode/navigate-new=] behaviour is used instead.
            </dd>
            <dt>
              <dfn data-dfn-for="client mode">focus-existing</dfn>
            </dt>
            <dd>
              If an existing web app client is open it is brought to focus but
              not navigated to the launch's target URL, instead the target URL
              is communicated via {{LaunchParams}} . If there are no existing
              web app clients the [=client mode/navigate-new=] behaviour is used
              instead.
              <p class="warning">
                It is necessary for the page to have a {{LaunchConsumer}} set on
                {{Window/launchQueue}} to receive the launch's {{LaunchParams}}
                and do something with it. If no action is taken by the page the
                user experience of the launch is likely going to appear broken.

          `client_mode` accepts a list of strings to allow sites to specify

          target=] is not supported by the user agent or platform. The first
          supported [=client mode target=] entry in the list gets used.
